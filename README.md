# Raman-ConvMSANet
This repo presents a high-accuracy Raman spectroscopy network that combines convolution and multi-head self-attention for the identification of biological species based on their blood and semen samples.

# Requirements
The code in this repo has been tested with the following software versions:
- Python 3.9.16
- Pytorch 2.0.0
- Numpy 1.23.5
- Scikit-learn 1.2.2

# Files
This repo should contain the following files:
- 1.lib - Data Loading Class for Raman Spectra of Species Blood and Semen.
- 2.model - Network Model.
- 3.utils - Neural Network Training Toolkit.
- 4.train.py - Main method for neural network training.
- 5.Reflection_best_checkpoint.pth - Training Weights for the Reflection Spectral Dataset.
- 6.Transmission_best_checkpoint.pth - Training Weigts for the Transmission Spectral Dataset.
